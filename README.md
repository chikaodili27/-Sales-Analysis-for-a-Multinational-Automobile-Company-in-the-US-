### Data Collection

Sales data was obtained from a central transaction database of the company representing orders placed by customers across multiple countries. Each record included attributes such as:

* `Customer ID`
* `OrderNo`
* `OrderQuantity`
* `CostPrice_usd`
* `SellingPrice_usd`
* `OrderDate`
* `CustomerName`
* `CustomerCity`
* `CustomerState`
* `CustomerCountry`
* `ProductCategory`
* `ProductColor`
* `Model`

### Data Pre-processing
**Data Loading**: 
Reading the Raw Dataset which originally existed as a CSV file into a Pandas Dataframe

```python


# solution

import pandas as pd

bikes_df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/Surfaces/Downloads/bikes.csv")



bikes_df.head()
```

### Data Inspection and Cleaning
- **1. Check for Missing values**:
```python 
# solution 


bikes_df.isna().any()
```
<img width="2387" height="473" alt="Check for Missing values" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47426d92-f6a3-4800-a4fd-b281499ac21f" />


```python

# Counting  the numbers of missing values

Total_number_of_missing_values_by_column =bikes_df.isna().sum()
Total_number_of_missing_values_by_column

```
<img width="2353" height="462" alt="numbers of missing values" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb6999a2-b154-481c-8224-8d3d365cde6f" />


```python 
# visualizing the total number of missing values 

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# using bar plot to visualize the missing values

Total_number_of_missing_values_by_column.plot(kind = "bar")

# to show the plot

plt.show()
```

- **2.Handling Missing values**:
```python

# solution 

# bikes_df["ProductColor"].mode()


bikes_df = bikes_df.fillna("Black")

bikes_df
```
<img width="1763" height="419" alt="Handling Missing values" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/317be98c-e434-4738-b02a-2b67e62ff865" />

```python
# to verify that there are no more missing values on our dataset

bikes_df.isna().any()
```

- **3. Check for  Duplicates**:
```python
# solution
# counting the total number of our datapoint

len(bikes_df)
```

# dropping any duplicate if any exist 

bikes_df.drop_duplicates(inplace = True)


- **4. Handling Duplicates**:
```python
# solution
# recounting our data point again 

len(bikes_df)
# This shows that there was no duplicate on our dataset
```


### Data Modification
```python
# generating some core metrics which were NOT provided from the dataset, which would be required for the purpose of the data analysis

# solution 

# (1) TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 


# (2) SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 


# (3) Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)


bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"]  - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


# Displaying the result

bikes_df.head()
```

### Data Filtering
```python
# Filtering out the required datasat (a subset data) for the analysis

# Total Profits generated by States in the US

# logical condition 1

is_usa = bikes_df['CustomerCountry'] ==	'United States'	

# logical condition 2

is_bike = bikes_df['ProductCategory'] == 'Bikes'	

bike_data_usa = bikes_df[(is_usa) & (is_bike)]

bike_data_usa

```python
# Entire Total Profits made from the US (Bike products only)

Total_Profits_of_entire_States = bike_data_usa["Profit"].sum()
Total_Profits_of_entire_States
```
```python
percent = (Total_Profits_the_Top_5_States / Total_Profits_of_entire_States)* 100


percent = percent.round(2)

### Data Interpretation
The Result from the data visualization above shows that **California**, **Washington**,  **Oregon**, **Florida** and **Wyoming** are the **top-5 states** generating the **highest profits** for **bike products** in the United States.


### Key Findings
---

---

* The analysis of bike product sales across the United States revealed that **California**, **Washington**, and **Oregon** are the top three states generating the highest profits by a significant margin.

* The top 5 most profitable states and their respective profit figures are as follows:

  | Rank | State      | Total Profit (\$) |
  | ---- | ---------- | ----------------- |
  | 1    | California | 2,247,278.04      |
  | 2    | Washington | 963,999.62        |
  | 3    | Oregon     | 457,411.67        |
  | 4    | Florida    | 3,206.34          |
  | 5    | Wyoming    | 2,868.76          |

* **California alone accounts for over \$2.2 million in profit**, contributes nearly half of the total profit from bike sales nationwide. Indicating a highly dominant market share.


* **Powerful Insight:** The combined total profit from these top 5 states accounts for **99.76% of the total profit** generated across all U.S. states for the bike product category.


* This reveals a **significant concentration of profitability**, with the remaining states contributing less than 0.24% of total profit.

* There is a **sharp drop in profit margins** between Oregon (3rd) and Florida (4th), suggesting a disparity in market performance between the top three states and the rest.

---

### Conclusions

---

* The U.S. market for the bike product is **heavily skewed**, with profitability overwhelmingly concentrated in just only five states accounting for **99.76% of the total profit** generated across all U.S. states for the bike product category.

  
* The remaining states exhibit **minimal or negligible sales impact**, indicating either very low market demand, lack of awareness, or distribution inefficiencies.


* The business is currently **over-reliant on a small subset of regions**, making it vulnerable to regional economic fluctuations or policy changes affecting those states.


* The profitability of bike products is **highly concentrated in the West Coast**, particularly in California, Washington, and Oregon.


* States like Florida and Wyoming, while making the top 5 list, generate **significantly lower profits**, indicating limited market penetration or demand.


* External factors such as **population density, cycling infrastructure, lifestyle preferences, and climate** may be influencing regional demand.

### Reconmendation

---

1. **Double Down and Strengthen Sales & Distribution in the Top 5 States**
   Allocate more resources (inventory, marketing budget, local partnerships) and Increase investment in California, Washington, and Oregon—such as to to maintain momentum ,  expand market dominance and defend market share.


2. **Investigate and Conduct Diagnostic Analysis on Low-Performing States**
   Investigate why the remaining  U.S. states contribute less than 1% of total profit. Is it due to poor distribution? Lack of infrastructure? Low demand? Use this to inform turnaround strategies.

3. **Explore Market Diversification**
   To reduce regional dependency, test and pilot tailored campaigns in new promising states with favorable cycling culture, infrastructure, or climate (e.g., Colorado, Arizona, North Carolina).


4. **Scenario Planning & Risk Management**
   Build contingency plans around the top-performing states—since any disruption in these areas could dramatically impact total profitability.

5. **Refine Product Strategy by Region**
   Consider regional customization of product offerings, pricing, or marketing based on the stark difference in performance across states.

6. **Optimize Marketing Strategy**
   Use insights from high-profit regions to craft region-specific campaigns—emphasizing outdoor lifestyle, health, and environmental benefits of biking.

7. **Monitor Trends Over Time**
   Continue to track sales and profitability metrics to identify shifting trends, seasonal patterns, and emerging markets across the country.
